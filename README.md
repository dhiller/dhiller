## Hey there, I’m Daniel Hiller

I'm a software engineer greybeard with a [history](https://dhiller.dev/history.html) of 20+ years transforming ☕ into useful stuff for others.

I’m currently part of the [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io) community, where I maintain, improve and automate CI using [Prow](https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/overview/) on [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io/) and [Golang](https://go.dev/) for various things.

Previously I’ve worked with Java, Jenkins, AWS, RDBMS and other things.

Sometimes I also talk about the things I do or did - you can find the talks I gave [here](https://dhiller.dev/presentation.html).
