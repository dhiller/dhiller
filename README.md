## Hey there, Iâ€™m Daniel Hiller

I'm a software engineer greybeard with a history of more than 20 years of transforming â˜• into useful stuff for others.

Iâ€™m currently part of the [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io) community, where I maintain, improve and automate CI using Prow on Kubernetes and Golang for various things.

Sometimes I also talk about the things I do or did - you can find the talks I gave [here](https://dhiller.dev/presentation.html).

Previously Iâ€™ve worked with Java, Jenkins, AWS, RDBMS and other things, see my [history](https://dhiller.dev/history.html) for more.
